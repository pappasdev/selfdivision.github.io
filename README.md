# selfdivision.github.io

This is the root that links various projects on GitHub. Some of these will also be hosted on my [official site](https://gpappas.dev) if they're portfolio worthy.

TODO:
- [ ] Make an index page.
- [ ] Link to projects.
- [x] Make a checkbox to check so it looks like I did something today.
